- ## Common Scenarios Vice Presidents Education Face
	- ==Scenario==: It is difficult to find the time to create a good, workable club schedule that keeps all 
	  members happy and moving forward in the Toastmasters education program.
	  **Possible solutions**: As much as possible, be prepared. Create schedules one or two months in advance and 
	  post them on the club’s website where everyone can see them or display them during club 
	  meetings.
	   Devise a system of automatic meeting role rotation, from simplest to most demanding; for 
	  example, each new member begins by presenting the thought of the day, then moves to 
	  Ah-Counter, then grammarian, then timer, and so on, until the new member fills a speaker 
	  role and eventually becomes Toastmaster of a meeting.
	- ==Scenario==: Members are not always willing to commit to meeting roles.
	  **Possible solutions**: Encourage each Toastmaster of the meeting to initiate an email discussion several days  before the meeting to confirm each member assigned to a meeting role is able to fulfill  their duties. Emphasize the importance of member participation and commitment, and  regularly acknowledge and thank members for their help in running quality meetings.
	- ==Scenario==: A longtime member refuses to do projects in Pathways and no longer wants to participate 
	  in the education program.
	  **Possible solutions**: Meet with the member and ask what can be done to help. Encourage them to gain  familiarity with Base Camp. If able, spend time walking the member through their first  project in Pathways. Explain the benefits of Pathways as clearly as possible, and remind  them that the heart of the club experience—i.e., speeches, evaluations, leadership, and  culture—has not changed
