	- ### Common Scenarios Vice Presidents Education Face
	  collapsed:: true
		- ==Scenario==: It is difficult to find the time to create a good, workable club schedule that keeps all 
		  members happy and moving forward in the Toastmasters education program.
		  **Possible solutions**: As much as possible, be prepared. Create schedules one or two months in advance and 
		  post them on the club’s website where everyone can see them or display them during club 
		  meetings.
		   Devise a system of automatic meeting role rotation, from simplest to most demanding; for 
		  example, each new member begins by presenting the thought of the day, then moves to 
		  Ah-Counter, then grammarian, then timer, and so on, until the new member fills a speaker 
		  role and eventually becomes Toastmaster of a meeting.
		- ==Scenario==: Members are not always willing to commit to meeting roles.
		  **Possible solutions**: Encourage each Toastmaster of the meeting to initiate an email discussion several days  before the meeting to confirm each member assigned to a meeting role is able to fulfill  their duties. Emphasize the importance of member participation and commitment, and  regularly acknowledge and thank members for their help in running quality meetings.
		- ==Scenario==: A longtime member refuses to do projects in Pathways and no longer wants to participate 
		  in the education program.
		  **Possible solutions**: Meet with the member and ask what can be done to help. Encourage them to gain  familiarity with Base Camp. If able, spend time walking the member through their first  project in Pathways. Explain the benefits of Pathways as clearly as possible, and remind  them that the heart of the club experience—i.e., speeches, evaluations, leadership, and  culture—has not changed

	- ## 职责概述
	- ### 俱乐部会议前
	  
	  *   在会议开始前五到七天，再次确认指派给会员的角色是否有问题。
	  *   为会议主持人提供支持，协助确认会员在会议中的角色；若有会员临时缺席，协助指派代理。
	  *   在下一次会议中，如有会员将获得教育奖，通知俱乐部主席进行相关准备。
	- ### 俱乐部会议到会后
	  
	  *   确认会议当日有角色的会员已经到达并且准备妥当。
	  *   提醒在会议中担任角色的会员为他们的项目找一位评估员。
	  *   协助会议主持人进行缺席会员的角色代理。
	  *   与来宾寒暄并询问其是否有参加会议活动的意愿，或只是纯粹旁听。
	  *   如果有来宾愿意参与，则告知主持人届时可邀请这些来宾参与即兴演讲，同时也请俱乐部主席在会议开始时介绍这些来宾。
	- ### 俱乐部会议中
	  
	  *   询问会员是否有任何人在等待 Base Camp 上对已完成的级别进行确认。
	  *   取得教育成就时，给予会员认可。
	  *   当俱乐部主席缺席时，主持会议。

	- ### 情形： 很难抽出时间，规划出一个能让所有人满意、达成 Toastmasters 教育项目、且切实可行的俱乐部日程规划
	  
	  **可能的解决方法：** 
	  
	  *   尽可能地充分准备。提前一到两个月制定计划，并且将信息公布在俱乐部网站上，让所有人都能看到，或在俱乐部会议上展示这些计划。
	  *   设计一套自动安排会议角色轮值的系统，并从最简单的工作到难度最大的工作排序；例如，让每名新会员先从最简单的表达会议当日想法开始，然后指派哼哈官、语法官、计时员等，依序加重角色任务，直到新会员累积足够经验来进行演讲或最终成为会议主持人，依照工作难度逐步学习。
	- ### 情形： 会员有时可能不愿意积极承担会议角色。
	  
	  **可能的解决方法：**
	  
	  *   鼓励每个会议主持人在每次会议几天前通过电子邮件进行讨论，确认会议中被指派会议角色的会员是否能够履行其职责。强调会员参与和投入的重要性，并定期对于他们在开展优质会议中提供的帮助给予认可和致谢。
	- ### 情形： 资深会员拒绝完成 Pathways 中的项目且不再想要参加教育项目
	  
	  **可能的解决方法：**
	  
	  *   约见该会员，询问您能帮他做些什么。 鼓励和激励他们熟悉 Base Camp。如果可以，抽出时间引导这些会员完成他们在 Pathways 中的第一个项目。 尽可能清楚地阐述 Pathways 的好处，提醒他们俱乐部体验的核心（即演讲、评估、领导和文化）并没有改变。如果会员青睐实物材料，向他们展示可订购的打印版学习路线.
