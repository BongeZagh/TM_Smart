- ## Common Scenarios Club Presidents Face
	- ==Scenario:== A member who is scheduled to fill a meeting role does not come to the meeting.
	  **Possible solutions:** Help the Toastmaster of the meeting fill the role by recruiting another member who does 
	  not already have an assigned role. If necessary, fill the role yourself.
	- ==Scenario:== A club officer is underperforming, frequently absent, or otherwise unable to fulfill their  duties, leaving the other club officers with more to do. Possible solutions: Examine your own leadership approach. Meet with the club officer and ask what can be  done to help. Engage, encourage, and energize them to develop and use the skills required  for the job.
	  ==Scenario:== A club member is difficult, controlling, or otherwise causing trouble at meetings.
	  **Possible solutions:** Contact the member immediately to discuss their behavior and listen to their point of  view. Often, this is enough to solve the problem, and is a required step if future disciplinary  action is taken against the member. Give the club member a task that focuses their  energies. Explain the importance of orderly, positive club meetings to the member.
	- If the club member needs to be removed, see the Club Constitution for Clubs of  Toastmasters International, Article II: Membership, Section 6, and Protocol 3.0:  Ethics and Conduct, Section 2.19
